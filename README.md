Data Acquisition using National Instruments DAQ

We used a DAQ NI USB-6002 data acquisition system, which is a low-cost DAQ USB Device, manufactured by National Instruments. The equipment is used to store and process data acquired by, a current transducer and a voltage transducer using labVIEW.

The given file must be opened in LabVIEW and is programmed to use 2 pins as input data, that will be triggered by another pin in falling or rising edge (one file for each kind). All values will be saved in a .csv file (The address must be set by the user).
